## fibonacci Service

This is a shell of a project which provides a fibonacci web service (a niche business requirement!)

The exercise is to complete an implementation of the service which takes an int and returns that position in the sequence.

The exercise is designed to be as close as possible to a normal working environment so feel free to consult documentation (google/stack overflow) although just googling an imlpementation of the algorithm would count as cheating!
